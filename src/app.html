Welcome! If you're here looking at this right now, that means you probably typed in my domain name after seeing my email address. The site isn't quite ready yet (clearly), but the Aurelia + Semantic UI infrastructure is already in place on Github Pages. Feel free to poke around and see what I'm working on, and thanks for your patience!
